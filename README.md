# MetricTWaveNet

**MetricTWaveNet** is a comprehensive framework for T-wave seismic event classification. It includes data preprocessing, feature-based machine learning, and deep metric learning pipelines for detecting and classifying oceanic T-phases from seismic waveform data.

## üîç Project Overview

T-waves are long-range oceanic acoustic signals converted from seismic waves. This project tackles the challenge of automatic T-wave classification, particularly distinguishing:
- No T-Phase
- Single T-Phase
- Multiple T-Phase

We compare the performance of:
1. **Scattering Transform + SVM** (DST baseline)
2. **CNN-based classifier**
3. **MetricTWaveNet** (deep metric learning with triplet loss)
